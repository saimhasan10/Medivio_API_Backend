<!-- serializer -->

Responsible for converting objects into data types understandable by javascript (JSON) and front end framework

In this DRF process what we don't use any form or templates for frontend so to make this backend useable to frontend we need to convert it into JSON so that any raw(HTML, CSS, JS), frameworks(react,nextjs) can use them
